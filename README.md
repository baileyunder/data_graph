# data_graph

## Overview

This project was made using JavaScript and a couple of libraries. It takes information that is inputted into a matrix and calcualtes the averages of each category within that matrix. Once done, it puts the information into a graph using a graph library called Chart.js. The graph can be rearranged into ascending and descending order and can be printed out.

## Tools Used

Repl.it Online Code Editor, Chart.js

## Challenges

â€ƒThe biggest challenge in this project was sorting the graph by ascending or descending order while also changing the colors and labels. It required event listeners to be put in place that would run a function to update the graph.
